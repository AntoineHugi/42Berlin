The purpose of this project was to recreate the behavior and functionality of some of the standard functions existing in the basic C libraries

There were a few constaints to follow:
 - individual functions cannot have more than 25 lines
 - Only the following existing functions are allowed : malloc, free, write
 - ternary operators, for and do loops are not allowed
